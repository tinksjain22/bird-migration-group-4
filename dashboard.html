        <p>This project will illustrate bird migration patterns over time, and will show how natural disasters, human activities, and seasonality impact this.</p>

        <h2>Migratory Flight Paths</h2>
        <p>In this visualization, the eight major bird migration routes are demonstrated. Typically, birds  migrate from north to south during the winters and from south to north during the summers.</p>

        <p>This map demonstrates the migration route of two Osprey birds.</p>
        <iframe src="html/index.html" width="1200" height="800"></iframe>
        <p>Here we can see an another view of bird migration patterns, with an average location per month. You can see how in the spring the birds fly north and in the winter, they fly south. The slider at the bottom of the map represents each month in the year.</p>

        <h2>Endangered Bird Species</h2>
        <p>This map demonstrates the number of threatened bird species present in each country. Use the dropdown list to zoom in over a specific continent. </p>

        <p>This graph shows the distribution of the different groups of birds that are endangered or at risk of being endangered. Use the dropdown to select either the breeding biome or the bird group.</p>

    <section id="fire">
        <h2>Wildfire Impact</h2>
        <p>Wildfire affects birds because of habitat destruction, decreased visibility due to smoke, and toxic carbon monoxide gas emitted from wildfire smoke. Here we demonstrate the worldwide distribution of wildfires from 2013 to 2023.</p>

        <p>In the heatmap below, you can see the top 10 countries with the most area burned over the 10 year period. </p>
        <iframe src="html/fire_heatmap.png" width="600" height="400"></iframe>

        <p>Taking a closer look at one of the top 10 countries burned between 2013- 2023 (Brazil), we can examine how wildfire impacts bird movement in more detail. Below you can see the number of reported wildfires in Brazil in 2013 and 2017 and how the increase in wildfires in 2017 limits the area in which the Great Kiskadee bird (Pitangus sulphuratus) is viewes in the country.</p>

    <section id="soybean_production">
        <h2>Agriculture/Soybean Prodcution Impact</h2>
        <p>Agriculture impacts birds because of insecticide use and deforestation, which impacts both their food source and their habitat. Soybeans are a crop gorwn throughout the world, we we selected this crop for the purposes of this analysis. Here we demonstrate soybean production across the world from 2013 - 2023. </p>
        <iframe src="html/soybeanproduction.html" width="1850" height="800"></iframe>
        <p>Zooming in on Brazil, you can see how with less soybean production in 2017, the Great Kiskadee bird (Pitangus sulphuratus) is more spread out, and with insectide use and deforestation brought on by increased agriculture in 2022, the bird sightings are much more clustered together and their flight area has descreased significantly. </p>
